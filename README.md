# Expect Exception


Expect Exception allows you to annotate cells in your [Jupyter notebook](https://ipython.org/) that you expect to raise exceptions.  Tracebacks from these exceptions get printed normally, but execution of the notebook does not halt with that cell.  This allows you to run all the cells in the notebook at once, and it makes testing notebooks with exception-raising cells possible.

## Installation

Expect Exception can be installed with pip:
```
pip install expectexception
```

## Usage

See the [README.ipynb](https://github.com/thedataincubator/expectexception/blob/master/README.ipynb) notebook for usage examples.
